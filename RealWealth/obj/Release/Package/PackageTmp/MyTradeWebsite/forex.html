                            <h4>How big is Forex ?</h4>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In April 2019, trade in FX market hit a6.6 trillion a day, up from a5.1 trillion three years earlier. FX derivatives rading growth, particularly in FX swaps, outpaced spot trading growth.</p>
                            

                            <h4>Why Forex Traders loose money ?</h4>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Their aim is to be successful and get payouts as people reach the foreign exchange market. And in certain situations, by having a certain structure they may adopt and having the market working in their favour, they continue to be efficient. Sadly, however, an ordinary Forex Trader is set to fail because trading is a zero-sum game where another group fails while one group of traders succeeds.</p>
